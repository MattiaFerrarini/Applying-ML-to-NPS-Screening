# Screening New Psychoactive Substances with ML

## The Project
The goal of this project is to train and test various ML models on the task of screening New Psychoactive Substances.

The project was inspired by the paper _Screening unknown novel psychoactive substances using GCâ€“MS based machine learning_ (Wong et al., 2023), available at https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468170923000358.
In the article, the reseachers employ an ANN, a CNN and a Random Forest to classify istances of various substances. This project extends their work by testing various ML models.
