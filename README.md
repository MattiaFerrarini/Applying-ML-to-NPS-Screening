# Screening New Psychoactive Substances with ML

## The Project
The goal of this project is to train and test various ML models on the task of screening New Psychoactive Substances.

The project was inspired by the paper _Screening unknown novel psychoactive substances using GCâ€“MS based machine learning_ (Wong et al., 2023), available at https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468170923000358.
In the article, the reseachers employ an ANN, a CNN and a Random Forest to classify various substances. 

This project extends their work by testing different ML models and analysing the feature importances.

## New Psychoactive Substances
New Psychoactive Substances (NPS) are substances that are designed to mimic the effects of established illicit drugs. 
The challenge with NPS is that their chemical structures can be altered easily, making it difficult for legislation to keep up. 
Moreover, The analysis and identification of a large number of chemically diverse substances present in drug markets at the same time is demanding.
